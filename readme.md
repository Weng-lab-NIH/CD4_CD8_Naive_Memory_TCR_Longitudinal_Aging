# DESCRIPTION

This main directory contains the scripts needed to run the TCR Data Processing and Data Analysis scripts. From the large raw FASTQ files generated from the Illumina Sequencing Machine, these scripts will generate the cleaned & processed FASTQ files specific for each human subject as well as numerical data (TCR species richness, Inverse Simpson Index, etc.) for each subject as well.
